**Q:** SaraHUD doesn't work, what do? <br>
**A:** First, make sure you followed the installation guide. Second, make sure you didn't edit any files, including path names. Also, make sure you use the latest version of your engine. As for Legacy versions, they are out of support and may not work on the latest versions of said engines, sorry.
