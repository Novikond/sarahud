# SaraHUD:Reborn

SaraHUD is a customizable HUD (Heads-Up Display) that runs in [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), an open-source game engine used for creating [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) mods.
## Installation

- Install [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)
- Install [SaraHUD](https://github.com/Novikond/sarahud-reborn)
- Put the "SaraHUD" folder into your Psych Engine "mods" folder.
- Open Psych Engine and go to the Mods menu
- Find the SaraHUD mod and click the "top" button
## Preferences

In future updates, we will implement an in-game menu so you won't have to use code editors.

For now, you can customise the HUD by changing the preferences in the "SaraHUD.lua" file in the "scripts" folder. Open SaraHUD.lua and you'll see a table called "pref". Change the settings in this table.

You can use [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus) or [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) to customise the preferences.
## Other

If you have any questions, there is a [SaraHUD Discord server](https://discord.gg/T4AzfvsXtb) where you can get help and support.

If you want to use this HUD, please give credits and link to this page.

Also, thank you for using my HUD and helping me to make it as good as possible.
